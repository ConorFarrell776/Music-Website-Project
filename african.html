<p id ="top">African Music
</p>


<p id="E1">The traditional music of Africa, given the vastness of the continent, is historically ancient, rich and diverse, 
with different regions and nations of Africa having many distinct musical traditions. Music in Africa is very important when it comes to religion. 
Songs and music are used in rituals and religious ceremonies, to pass down stories from generation to generation, as well as to sing and dance to.
</p>
<p id ="E1">
Traditional music in most of the continent is passed down orally (or aurally) and is not written. In Sub-Saharan African music traditions, 
it frequently relies on percussion instruments of every variety, including xylophones, djembes, drums, and tone-producing instruments such as 
the mbira or "thumb piano."
</p>
<p id ="E1">
The music and dance of the African diaspora, formed to varying degrees on African musical traditions, include American music and many Caribbean genres, such as
 soca, calypso (see kaiso) and zouk. Latin American music genres such as the rumba, conga, bomba, cumbia, salsa and samba were founded on the 
 music of enslaved Africans, and have in turn influenced African popular music.[1]
</p>
<p id ="E1">
Like the music of Asia, India and the Middle East, it is a highly rhythmic music. African music consists of complex rhythmic patterns, often involving one rhythm played against another to 
create a polyrhythm. The most common polyrhythm plays three beats on top of two, like a triplet played against straight notes. 
Beyond the rhythmic nature of the music, African music differs from Western music in that the various parts of the music do not necessarily 
combine in a harmonious fashion. African musicians unlike Western musicians, do not seek to combine different sounds in a way that is pleasing to 
the ear. Instead their aim is to express life, in all its aspects, through the medium of sound. Each instrument or part may represent a particular 
aspect of life, or a different character; the through-line of each instrument/part matters more than how the different instruments and parts fit 
together. Understanding African music gets even more difficult when you consider that it does not have a written tradition; there is little or no 
written music to study or analyze. 
</p>
<p id ="E1">
This makes it almost impossible to notate the music – especially the melodies and harmonies – using the Western staff. There are subtle differences 
in pitch and intonation that do not easily translate to Western notation. That said, African music most closely adheres to Western tetratonic 
(three-notes), pentatonic (five-note), hexatonic (six-note), and heptatonic (seven-note) scales. Harmonization of the melody is accomplished by 
singing in parallel thirds, fourths, or fifths. Another distinguishing form of African music is its call-and-response nature: one voice or 
instrument plays a short melodic phrase, and that phrase is echoed by another voice or instrument. The call-and-response nature extends to the 
rhythm, where one drum will play a rhythmic pattern, echoed by another drum playing the same pattern. African music is also highly improvised. 
(This speaks to the lack of a written tradition.) A core rhythmic pattern is typically played, with drummers then improvising new patterns over the static original patterns
